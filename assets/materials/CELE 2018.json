    "question": "Strontium-90 is a waste product from nuclear reactors. As a consequence of fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests, we all have a measurable amount of strontium-90 in our bones. The half-life of strontium-90 is 28 years, meaning that after 28 years a given amount of the substance will have decayed to the half of the original amount. Find the exponential decay model for strontium-90. Suppose that a nuclear accident occurs and releases 60 grams of strontium-90 into the atmosphere. How long will it take for strontium-90 to decay to a level of 20 grams?",
